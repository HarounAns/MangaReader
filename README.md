## Manga Reader App - for Fanfics

Currently only has Dragonball AF, looking to add more manga soon, as well as move away from storing local copies and retrieving from cloud.

## Installation is easy.

Must have node/npm on machine

#### Steps:
```
git clone https://github.com/HarounAns/MangaReader.git
cd MangaReader
npm install
npm start
```

A window should open up on your default browser taking you to the app!
